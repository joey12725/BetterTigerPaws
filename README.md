# Better Tiger Paws

A dynamic web application that aids students and administrators to keep track of class schedules, create new class schedules and view old class schedules. This product will be used by Trinity University for registration periods and is public facing and will handle up to 25k requests a month. 

Problems with Current Solution:
The current solution (TigerPaws) has many flaws and faults. Our system is meant to tackle and solve each problem in different ways. The first problem is TigerPaws tries to do too much and subsequently is very clunky. On top of dealing with class schedules, you can do class audits, payment plans, grades, and a few other things. This makes the UI difficult to navigate and intuitively understand. For instance, the difference between “Class Schedules/Most Current” and “My Class Schedule” is hard to grasp. BetterTigerPaws will tackle this issue by only dealing with class schedules and nothing else. Then in the future, a future developer team could create a hub that incorporates BetterTigerPaws into it to add additional functionality and make everything more compartmentalized. 

The next issue is responsiveness. TigerPaws when at peak usage (during registration times) are slow and unresponsive. Inputs get missed and changes are made on the server side and aren’t adequately relayed to the user. This causes major frustration when your academic career is on the line. BetterTigerPaws will solve this by using AWS Cloud services for elastic and scalable hosting so the servers will horizontally grow with the traffic. 

The last problem is the design and layout of TigerPaws. It looks outdated and old-fashioned. The colors are unsaturated and the palette feels bland. It doesn’t use its space well with multiple large open areas everywhere and things aren’t centered in a consistent manner. We’ll solve this by using modern design layout and color structure.
